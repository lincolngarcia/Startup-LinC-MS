## Git Setup

I learned that github cli and git cli are different and much each be installed from different locations.

## AWS

I decided to go with AWS Amplify for its lightweight design.
I discovered that Amplify doesn't provide a static IP address, but handles routing from its backend.

## Caddy

No problems worked just like it said in the [instruction](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md).

## HTML

I didn't know how to do HTML comments in the Amplify with React context, but I figured it out. It was pretty easy to do, but I feel like its hard to develop HTML for features that aren't built yet. I also learned that you need to double check that your site deployed...

## CSS

TailwindCSS updated to version 4 recently. The children of a flex-grow (it itself being a child of flex-column) will not be able to reference height until its parent has a fixed height

## React Part 1: Routing

While React likes to use Router(), NextJS prefers the <Link> convention.

## React Part 2: Reactivity

useEffect is cool, however I still prefer to use VueJS's emit and dynamic prop properties

## Service

It The API as pretty simple to work with, although I now know not to submit private API keys to a public github

## Database

It was pretty easy to set up, but If I could go back I would not make it cloud based for performance
